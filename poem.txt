Friends, Romans, countrymen  Lend me your ears
I come to bury Casear, not to priase him.
The evil that men do in their lives lives long after them, 
while the good is oft interrred with their bones.
So let it be with Caesar.

Brutus claims that Caesar was ambitious.

O Pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these buthers
Thou are the ruin of the noblest man
Who eer lived in the tide of times
